            <h3>Hi &#128075;, I'm Bailey Johnson.</h3>
            <p>I'm a full-stack software engineer on the Mission Systems Operations Contract at NASA's Johnson Space Center &#128640; I graduated from Coastal Carolina University (B.S. in Computer Science) in May of 2020 and have since relocated to the Houston-area.</p>
            <p>I initially built this portfolio to compliment my resume, as somewhere I could showcase my personal projects.  What you're viewing now is actually the second version (view the source for the old version <a href="https://github.com/baileywjohnson/portfolio-old" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>) which includes my personal blog and is one of the projects I've used to sharpen my React + UI-design skills.</p>
