# portfolio

This is the second version of my personal portfolio.  I chose to use React and host the application on Github Pages.  The app makes use of some newer React features (functional components, useState/useEffect hooks), [react-router] (https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router), and [react-icons] (https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/).
