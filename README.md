# portfolio

This is the second version of my personal portfolio.  I chose to use React and host the application on Github Pages.  The app makes use of Typescript, some newer React features (functional components, hooks), [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router), [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) and [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components).  I'm using HashRouter over BrowserRouter since GH pages doesn't support routers that use the HTML5 pushState history API under the hood.
