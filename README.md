# portfolio

This is the second version of my personal portfolio.  Built with React and hosted on Github Pages.  The app makes use of Typescript, [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router), [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) and [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components).
